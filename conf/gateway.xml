        <description>
            Comma-separated list of additional docker files to run to set up the gateway.
            DockerFiles must start with line "FROM dev_cluster/gateway"
            and be located under /docker/contrib-gateway.

        <description>
            Comma separated list of additional ports to be opened on gateway.
            Port specs are of the form "$port_description/$exposed_port_num:$portNum"
            $port_description is optional and used for display in list-gateway.
            $exposed_port_num is optional, and will provide a hard-binding.

            <description>
                This is a hard-binding of gateway container port 9400 to external port 9400, which makes it easier for the user
                to access the port from browser, without having to query via list-gateway.  But prevents multiple such gateways from starting due to conflict.

            Given a command "dev-cluster gateway $mycluster", it will search for this directory to get the Hadoop/Hive client conf.
            The directory would be located under ./hadoop-resources/hadoop-conf/
