   <property>
     <name>target.hadoop.conf.dir</name>
     <value></value>
     <description>Name of a directory (under ./hadoop-resources) that will has hadoop conf that dev cluster will spawn with.
        Make sure you create the folder as a copy of the default conf at ./hadoop-resources/cluster-default, which has
        the minimum configuration to spawn a cloud CDH cluster.

         You can then add your own configurations to the specific conf-xml file as you like.
         Variables you may use include $master (will be replaced by the cluster master hostname)
         and $local (will be replaced by the local node's host name).

    <!-- See below, we only spawn CDH5 on ubuntu trusty dev clusters for now,
         so this would have to point to a valid version under
         http://archive.cloudera.com/cdh5/ubuntu/trusty/amd64/cdh/dists/ -->
    <property>
        <name>target.hadoop.version</name>
        <value>cdh5.5.0</value>
        <description>
            CDH version to download.
            For now we only support CDH5 repositories of ubuntu trusty.
            This would have to be a valid version listed under:
            http://archive.cloudera.com/cdh5/ubuntu/trusty/amd64/cdh/dists/

            Later, we can expand it to use Apache Bigtop
